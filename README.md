# EntrySafe: Facial Recognition Security System for Drop-off and Pick-up

_A Desktop Application using Python & PyQt_

---

## 📌 Overview

EntrySafe is a facial recognition–based security system designed to enhance safety and accountability during student drop-off and pick-up. The system identifies guardians through real-time facial scanning and automatically logs student attendance. In cases where a guardian is not recognized, the system initiates a verification workflow that involves staff and the parent.

This project was developed as a secure and automated replacement for traditional manual attendance and gate-entry monitoring.
